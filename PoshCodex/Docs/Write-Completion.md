# Write-Completion

## SYNOPSIS

This function is called when the keybind is hit, and should only be called by hitting the keybind, NOT manually because that would defeat the purpose of completion (since this function reads the current buffer and tries to generate the completion).

## SYNTAX

```
Write-Completion [<CommonParameters>]
```
