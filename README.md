## What is it?

This is a powershell plugin that enables you to use OpenAI's powerful Codex AI in the command line. OpenAI Codex is the AI that also powers GitHub Copilot.
To use this plugin you need to get access to OpenAI's [Codex API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/).

Forked from the impressive [zsh version of this extension by Tom Doerr](https://github.com/tom-doerr/zsh_codex).

## How to Install

### 1. Through PowerShellGallery (recommended)

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PoshCodex -Force

# To check if it's installed properly:
Get-Module -Name PoshCodex # should display the Invoke-Completion command

echo "`nImport-Module PoshCodex" >> $PROFILE
```

### 2. By cloning this repository

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rishi255/posh_codex
cd .\posh_codex\PoshCodex\

# Install Invoke-Build module to build the module
Install-Module InvokeBuild -Force -RequiredVersion 3.2.1
Invoke-Build -File build.ps1

# Now import the built module
Import-Module .\Output\temp\PoshCodex\<version_number>\PoshCodex.psd1

# Now the module can be used.
```

## Configuration of the OpenAI Codex API Key

This module requires access to the OpenAI Codex API for best results. You can join the waitlist for a Codex API key by following the instructions [here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/).

Until you get a Codex API key, you can use the [GPT-3 OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/docs/developer-quickstart/your-api-keys) by signing up on the OpenAI website.  
**_However, the base GPT-3 model is not tailored for code completions and hence the suggestions are not even close to the ones from the Codex API._**

The module expects an environment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY to be set in the environment.
You can set it with the following command:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

TODO - Add usage instructions

```powershell
# Import the module first to activate the keybind (can be done in your $PROFILE that runs on every shell start)
Import-Module PoshCodex

# Now you can use the keybinds for completion
# If the keybind is Ctrl+Alt+X (default), then:

# type some comment that describes what you want to do, eg:
"# install the 'scoop' module" # minus the quotes

# Just hit Ctrl+Alt+X (or your own keybind if changed) and the AI will write the corresponding code for you.
```

## TODO checklist

- [x] Test basic PS plugin working with hardcoded completions
- [x] Test plugin by scraping the generated output from [my text-to-PowerShell OpenAI playground.](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/4FqkeG4WQuIPfOUS6cvXQfQR?model=davinci), until a Codex API key is received.
- [x] Publish package on NuGet for testing whether all is working fine
- [x] Test NuGet package by installing and running
- [x] Publish plugin for installation through PSGallery
- [x] Add installation instructions to README.md
- [x] Integrate with GitHub Actions to auto-publish new versions
- [ ] Publish plugin for installation through Scoop
- [ ] Add a way to change the hotkey for completion - currently it's `Ctrl+Alt+x`
- [ ] Test plugin robustness in PowerShell using Codex API key
- [ ] Add GIF of working demo in terminal
